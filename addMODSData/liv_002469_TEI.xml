<lb/><p>I begin a letter now 
<lb/>in order to be part ready 
<lb/>when we come to <placeName>Zanzibar</placeName> which may be in a week 
<lb/>hence. We are getting on 
<lb/>pretty well but such a 
<lb/>rolling ship never was 
<lb/>known by the name of 
<lb/>a pleasure yacht. I suppose 
<lb/>she was sold in <placeName>England</placeName> because she was so 
<lb/>lively. As soon as we 
<lb/>sit down to dinner 

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_002469_0002"/><!--pb/@n='33v'-->
<lb/>our entire attention is taken 
<lb/>up in balancing the soup 
<lb/>plates. If you forget the 
<lb/>vessel in your hand, the 
<lb/>other vessel gives a lurch. 
<lb/>and the greasy fluid flows 
<lb/>into your lap. Fancy a 
<lb/>comfortable old gentleman 
<lb/><add place="above">about my size</add> taking a bath while she is 
<lb/>playing her beastly pranks. 
<lb/>One bucket of salt water 
<lb/>is all he can venture to put 
<lb/>in. One moment he is 
<lb/>holding on by the sides to 
<lb/>avoid sliding to the other 
<lb/>end. the next the mad 
<lb/>fluid sloshes up to his 
<lb/>chest &amp; mouth, and the 
<lb/>mice in their holes &amp; the 

	<pb n="0003" facs="liv_002469_0003"/><!--pb/@n='34r'-->
<lb/><!--hand0134-->very flies on the wall laugh 
<lb/>at him. Most of the marine 
<lb/>sepoys were sick. You 
<lb/>would have been a victim 
<lb/>unless you had tried the 
<lb/>new remedy of a bag of 
<lb/>pounded ice along the spine, 
<lb/>which sounds as hopeful 
<lb/>as the old cure for 
<w>tooth-<lb break="no"/>ache,</w> namely, "take a 
<w>mouth-<lb break="no"/>ful</w> of cold water &amp; sit on the 
<lb/>fire till it boils. You 
<lb/>will suffer no more from 
<lb/>toothache " We have had 
<w>no-<lb break="no"/>thing</w> to attract our attention 
<lb/>in coming over this wide 
<lb/>waste of waters - a sea broke 
<lb/>one of the boats so that half of 
<lb/>it was swept away &amp; two 
<lb/>seedies or black sailors were 
<lb/>taken with it. The life buoys 

	<pb n="0004" facs="liv_002469_0004"/><!--pb/@n='34v'-->
<lb/>were thrown to them and a 
<lb/>boat lowered &amp; they were 
<lb/>picked up. All the sailors 
<lb/>are <add place="above">either</add> Lascars or Seedies. They 
<lb/>get confused in any 
<lb/>emergency. The <persName>Captain</persName>
<lb/>had to go &amp; shew them every 
<lb/>rope to be hauled when 
<lb/>taking in sail, and I took 
<lb/>the wheel and brought her 
<lb/>"up in the wind" while the 
<lb/>above affair took place. 
<lb/>This stopped the ship's course 
<lb/>otherwise we should have 
<lb/>left the poor fellows 
<w>hope-<lb break="no"/>lessly</w> out of sight. A 
<lb/>shark took a bite at the 
<lb/>revolving vane of the 
<lb/>patent log today. He 
<lb/>left some pieces of the 
<lb/><!--hand01top right 35--><!--hand02top left 2/4-->

<lb/>enamel of his teeth in the 
<lb/>brass, and probably has the 
<lb/><term type="ailment">toothache;</term> you will of 
<lb/>course sympathize with 
<lb/>him. The vane revolves 
<lb/>in the water and the number 
<lb/>of revolutions are registered 
<lb/>in a little machine in 
<lb/>front of it so that the 
<lb/>distance travelled over is 
<lb/>known. It trails behind the 
<lb/>ship. </p>
<lb/><p>If you ask <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Murray</persName>
<lb/>to send by <persName>M<hi rend="underline"><hi rend="sup">r</hi></hi> Conyingham</persName>

<lb/>When you return home you 
<lb/>will be scrutinized to see if 
<lb/>you are spoiled. You have 
<lb/>only to act naturally &amp; 
<lb/>kindly to all your old 
<lb/>friends to disarm their 
<lb/>prejudices. I think you 
<lb/>will find the <persName>Youngs</persName> true 
<lb/>friends. <persName>M<hi rend="sup">rs</hi> Williamson</persName>
<lb/>of <placeName>Widdicombe hill</placeName> near 
<lb/><placeName>Bath</placeName> writes to me that 
<lb/>she would like to shew you 
<lb/>her plans for the benefit 
<lb/>of poor orphans. If you 
<lb/>thought of going to <placeName>Bath</placeName>
<lb/>it might be well to get 
<lb/>all the insight you could 
<lb/>into that, and every other 
<lb/>good work. It is well to be

<lb/><!--hand01top right 36-->able to take a comprehensive 
<lb/>view of all benevolent 
<lb/>enterprises, and resolve 
<lb/>to do our duty in life in 
<lb/>some way or other for 
<lb/>we cannot live for 
<w>our-<lb break="no"/>selves</w> alone. A life of 
<w>self-<lb break="no"/>ishness</w> is one of misery. 
<lb/>and it is unlike that of 
<lb/>our blessed saviour who 
<lb/>pleased not himself. He 
<lb/>followed not his own 
<lb/>will even, but the will of 
<lb/>his father in Heaven. I have 
<lb/>read with much pleasure 
<lb/>a book called "Rose Douglas" 
<lb/>It is the life of a minister's 
<lb/>daughter with ficticious 
<lb/>names, but all true. She 
<lb/>was near <placeName>Lanark</placeName> and 
<lb/>came through <placeName>Hamilton</placeName> you

<lb/>had better read it if you come 
<lb/>in contact with it. </p>
<lb/><p>I would not stop too long 
<lb/>at <placeName>Newstead Abbey.</placeName> Travelling 
<lb/>about is very expensive.If <persName>Tom</persName> &amp; <persName>Oswell</persName> go again to

<lb/>them. </p>
<lb/><p>What a mistake to say any 
<lb/>thing about the <unclear cert="low">Marsauceaux</unclear>
<lb/>wine before the review 
<lb/>was written. If I say now 
<lb/>that it was very good. It 
<lb/>really had something very

<lb/><!--hand01 top right 37--><!--hand04 top left 3/-->You did not mention 
<lb/>what you considered most 
<lb/>precious on the night of the 
<lb/>fire, so I dreamed that I 
<lb/>saw one young lady 
<w>hug-<lb break="no"/>ging</w> a German Grammar 
<lb/>to her bosom - another with 
<lb/>a pair of curling tongs - a 
<lb/>toothpick and a pinafore. 
<lb/>Another with a bunch of 
<lb/>used up postage stamps &amp; 
<lb/>autographs in a crinoline 
<lb/>turned upside down, and 
<lb/>a fourth lifted up <persName>Madame 
<lb/><unclear cert="low">Hocede</unclear></persName> &amp; insisted on carrying 
<lb/>her as her most precious 
<lb/>baggage. Her name which I 
<lb/>did not catch will go down to 
<lb/>posterity alongside of the ladies 
<lb/>who each carried out her 
<lb/>husband from the besiged city 
<lb/>&amp; took care never to let him 

	<pb n="0010" facs="liv_002469_0010"/><!--pb/@n='37v'-->
<lb/>hear the last of it afterwards. 
<lb/>I am so penetrated with 
<w>ad-<lb break="no"/>miration</w> of her that I enclose 
<lb/>the wing of a flying fish for 
<lb/>her. It lighted among us last 
<lb/>night while we were at 
<w>din-<lb break="no"/>ner</w> coming right through 
<lb/>the skylight - You will make 
<lb/>use of this fact in the high flying 
<lb/>speech which you will deliver 
<lb/>there in French </p>

<lb/>take advice. They put no 
<lb/>accounts down - make 
<lb/>no memoranda so are 
<lb/>at the mercy of any one 
<lb/>who gives them a fair story 
<lb/>I cannot interfere further

<lb/>a brass band which he 
<lb/>got at <placeName>Bombay</placeName> blared 
<lb/>forth "God Save the Queen" 
<lb/>This was excessively ludicrious 
<lb/>but I maintained sufficient 
<lb/>official gravity. After 
<lb/>coffee &amp; sherbert we came 
<lb/>away and the wretched 
<lb/>band now struck up "The 
<lb/>British Grenadiers" as if 
<lb/>the fact of my being only 
<lb/>5 ft 8 &amp; <unclear cert="low"> Brebner</unclear> about 
<lb/>2 inches lower ought not

<lb/><p>There can be no doubt of 
<lb/>the <persName>Baron Van der Decken's</persName>
<lb/>death. He was excessively 
<lb/>aggressive. &amp; over bearing 
<lb/>entertaining the utmost 
<lb/>contempt for the natives 
<lb/>and taking pains on all 
<lb/>occasions to shew that 
<lb/>contempt. His Hauteur 
<lb/>was accompanied with 
<lb/>great stinginess in small 
<lb/>matters. This was the 
<lb/>more remarkable 
<w>in-<lb break="no"/>asmuch</w> as he bought two

<lb/>but I had only three men 
<lb/>on whom I could depend 
<lb/>and I felt it would not be 
<lb/>wise to go in so short 
<lb/>handed. The poor man 
<lb/>had so much contempt 
<lb/>for the natives that up to 
<lb/>the moment when they 
<lb/>pinioned him he never
