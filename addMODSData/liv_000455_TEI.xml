<lb/><p rend="left">Dear Sir.</p><!-- Inserted period to reflect text HB 7/7/12 -->
<lb/><p>Being very desirous, for some years past, to devote my life to the 
<lb/>cause of missions, and thinking, at one time, that my education for that purpose 
<lb/>might be prosecuted throughout by the fruits of my own industry; after a 
<lb/>trial of one season at some medical, and other classes I find that this 
<lb/>is nearly impracticable:  Observing frequent appeals for missionaries,  
<lb/>in the Evangelical Magazine, and talking over the matter to my pastor 
<lb/>the <persName>Rev.<hi rend="sup">nd</hi> M.<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Moir</persName> of the <choice><sic>Independant</sic><corr>Independent</corr></choice> church, <placeName><settlement type="town">Hamilton</settlement></placeName>, I was encouraged <!-- Inserted coding for correct spelling of Independent HB 7/7/12 -->
<lb/>to offer myself to your society:  and, subsequently, I received information to 
<lb/>give an account of my christian experience, Doctrinal views, and Christian 
<lb/>motives, which I now endeavour shortly to give.</p>
<lb/><p>Through the merciful providence of a gracious god, it was my <choice><sic>privelege</sic><corr>privilege</corr></choice> to enjoy the
<lb/>instructions, example, and prayers, of pious parents, who still walk before god in the 
<lb/>land of the living. These, however, had no effect on my desperately wicked heart, only 
<lb/>serving to restrain me, in some measure, from outward immorality; When about my 
<lb/>twelfth year, I was visited with great distress of mind on account of my sinfulness, and 
<lb/>anxious desire to possess the peace of mind, and happiness, which I felt convinced, 
<lb/>the true christian alone enjoyed, This I could not attain, because of my looking 
<lb/>continually within for an effect, which I thought must be produced there, by 
<lb/>the spirit of god, ere I could be entitled to take the benefit of the gospel, and 
<lb/>this delusion being strengthened by some preaching, which I then heard, my only 
<lb/>course appeared to be, just to wait the good pleasure <add place="above">of</add> god.  Thus, continuing to look for 
<lb/>another ground of hope, than the finished work of christ, I found neither peace nor 
 
       

	<pb n="0002" facs="liv_000455_0002"><!--pb/@n='1v'--></pb>
<lb/>happiness, which caused me, (never having revealed the state of my mind to any one) often to 
<lb/>bewail my sad state with tears in secret.  The anxiety of my mind after some time abated 
<lb/>but a perpetual uneasiness, a soreness of heart still remained, which no amusements <del type="cancelled">nor</del>
<lb/>nor pursuit could assuage, Until in my nineteenth year, it pleased god in <choice><orig>mercifull</orig><reg>merciful</reg></choice>
<lb/>kindness &amp; compassion to <choice><orig>shew</orig><reg>show</reg></choice> me my folly &amp; error, by means of a work, entitled,
<lb/>"The Philosophy of a future state," previous to reading which though <choice><orig>sceptical</orig><reg>skeptical</reg></choice> thoughts 
<lb/>were not actually entertained, concerning the reality of the existence of such a state 
<lb/>yet it had no influence whatever on <add place="below">^</add><add place="above">my</add> conduct, If I bestowed on them a thought 
<lb/>Heaven had no attractions for me, and Hell was never an object of alarm. But now <del type="cancelled">full</del>
<lb/>full conviction of their relation to me, filled my mind, and I likewise felt that the 
<lb/>atoning work of <persName>Christ</persName> was the only ground on which I could hope to find peace 
<lb/>to my soul here, and enjoy the prospects of bliss hereafter, and enabled by divine 
<lb/>grace to cast myself on the mercy of god through Christ. a peace and joy entered 
<lb/>my heart, to which till then I had been an entire stranger.  This has
<lb/>occasionaly been interrupted by <choice><sic>unbeleiving</sic><corr>unbelieving</corr></choice> doubts &amp; fears, but with the help
<lb/>of a gracious god, I have been enabled to dismiss these, by repairing to the only 
<lb/>hope of the sinner, the lamb that was slain.  and now, trusting that he will keep 
<lb/>me from falling, through life, and believing he will save me at last, not for anything 
<lb/>I am, or can do, for I see nothing in me nor about me to merit such great mercy 
<lb/>but on the contrary every thing deserving the wrath and curse of god through eternity:  
<lb/>But solely, through his own <choice><sic>sovreign</sic><corr>sovereign</corr></choice> grace &amp; love, flowing through the propitiatory blood 
<lb/>of <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> his son.</p>
<lb/><p>That, the scriptures of the old and new Testaments, are a revelation of the will 
<lb/>of god to fallen man, this being attested by such evidence as no one with <add place="below">an</add> unbiased
<lb/>mind can resist.  That they contain a perfect rule of faith and practice. "All

<lb/>scripture being given by inspiration of god, and profitable for doctrines for 
<lb/>reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,"  From these we learn that 
<lb/>there is one god, in three persons, Father, son, and holy spirit; that he is the creator 
<lb/>preserver, and moral governor of the universe__ That man was created by him holy 
<lb/>and happy.  but broke his law, and introduced rebellion into the world, thereby 
<lb/>losing the favour and image of god, and entailing sin and misery on himself and all 
<lb/>his posterity, "By one man sin entered into the world," and "by one man's disobedience 
<lb/>many were made sinners"__ The total depravity of all men, "There is none righteous, no, not one" 
<lb/>God's righteous law being violated, man might have been justly condemned to eternal 
<lb/>punishment, the desert of his sin, but god, in infinite mercy and love, devised a 
<lb/>way whereby the claims of his justice are satisfied and the sinner saved, By the <w>substitu-

<lb/>own deliverance from the pollution of sin- all are invited to accept salvation through <persName>Christ</persName>
<lb/>but because of the moral depravity of man, a divine influence is <choice><sic>necassary</sic><corr>necessary</corr></choice> to make him 
<lb/>willing to receive it, which is promised to all who ask it; and those who choose to reject this
